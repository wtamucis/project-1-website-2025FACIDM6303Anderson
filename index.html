    <img src="images/elves.jpg" alt="Awakening of the Elves under starlight" title="Awakening of the Elves" width="800" height="533" class="hero-img">

    <p>We focus on the <b>First</b> and <b>Second</b> Ages — the eras most viewers never see. We summarize events the films don't show and the series only hints at, keeping a clear line between what is <i>canon</i> and what is reasonable context. These ancient times are honestly pretty fascinating once you dig into them — they hold the foundations of everything that comes after, from the creation of the Silmarils to the forging of the Rings of Power. Understanding these epochs really helps when you're trying to appreciate the full scope of Tolkien's work.</p>
    
    <p>The Valar — sometimes called "gods" — are basically powerful guardians who shape the world and live in the Undying Lands of the West. Mortals do <b>not</b> become immortal by visiting that land; it simply isn't their destiny. The Valar represent different aspects of creation and governance, each with their own domain and responsibility. Their involvement in Middle-earth's affairs decreases over time, as they gradually step back to let the Free Peoples determine their own destinies.</p>
    
    <p>We track the arrivals of <i>Elves</i> (under starlight), <i>Dwarves</i> (crafted by Aulë then blessed), and <i>Men</i> (at first sunrise), then give you a quick orienting list. Each kindred brings unique gifts and perspectives to Middle-earth, and their interactions shape the great events of these early ages. The choices made by individuals from each race ripple through time, influencing events thousands of years later during the War of the Ring.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Valar:</b> guardian powers who shape the world; they guide but do not control free will.</li>

        <li><b>Melkor/Morgoth:</b> first rebel; his marring sets the stage for later evils.</li>
